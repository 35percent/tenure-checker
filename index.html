           <h2>Why check my tenure?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
            Housing associations are taking advantage of the growing confusion of different affordable tenures and charging higher rents than they should.
            Housing associations are playing an increasing role in the provision of London's social housing. They now manage over 400,000 homes - nearly twice as many as they did twenty years ago.
            This is partly a result of the increasing role that section 106 provision is playing and the associated funding programmes.
            More than 120,000 affordable homes <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/affordable_housing_starts_and_completions_-_end_of_september_2020.xls">have been built with mayoral funding</a> in the past ten years alone. 
            
            Recent mayoral funding programmes have included no less than five different types of affordable housing rental tenures:</p>
            
            <ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item align-items-center">Social Rent (set according to the National Rent Regime and pegged to average local incomes - currently around £122 pw in London)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item align-items-center">London Affordable Rent (capped at benchmark levels set by the Mayor, currently around 30% higher than social rent)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item align-items-center">Capped Affordable Rent (capped at 50% market rent)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item align-items-left">London Living Rent (set at one third of average gross local earnings. On average, across London, they are about 67% of market rents)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item align-items-left">Affordable Rent (up to 80% market rent)</li>
</ul>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
          The Mayor's several funding programmes generally award a higher level of grant, the more affordable the tenure is - i.e. promising to build homes and let them at social rents currently attracts up to xx per home, whereas affordable rent attracts xx. 
          The problem is that once a housing association has received funding and built the homes there is very little in the way of controls or monitoring to ensure that housing associations don't charge higher rents than they should. This is because neither the Mayor nor local authorities keep a register of affordable homes built with grant funding or delivered by developers under section 106 agreements.</p>

          <h2>The Project</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
          Our S106 Rent Checker is a first step towards making housing associations in London operate in a fairer and more transparent way for tenants and charge the social rents agreed at planning approval or by funding agreements.
          There are three parts to the project:
           <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"> The Register - build a public register of all the (xxx,000) affordable homes secured via section 106 agreements in the past ten years.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> The Lookup Tool - an online web application that will allow tenants to look up their address, find out if their home is subject to a section 106 agreement and discover if the rent charged by the housing association is higher than it should be.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> The Reporting Tool – a facility to enable tenants to seek advice or make a complaint about the housing association to their local authority/GLA if the rent charged is higher than the level required by the section 106 agreement.</li>            
            </ul>
          </p>
          
          
          
          <h2>Why are local authorities and the Mayor reluctant to act?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
            First, the current situation is convenient because they are able to claim that they have secured x number of new social rented homes and it would be politically embarrassing to acknowledge that they have been provided as a different tenure (or not at all).
              Second, because of the nature of their reporting system, neither local authorities or the Mayor are actually able to monitor the tenure of affordable homes because they don't have a record of the addresses or access to them through the housing associations.
        </p>
        <h2>How do we aim to make them act?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
                     <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"> Lobbying the Mayor and London Assembly members </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> Approaching and working with progressive Councils and housing associations - see for example <a href="https://www.southwark.gov.uk/innovate/collabrative-project/affordable-housing-monitoring">this joint project</a> between Southwark Council, Peabody and DXW.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> Using the new FOI regulations proposed under the forthcoming <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">Charter for Social Housing white paper</a> to build the register. </li>
            
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h2>How does this Checker comply with the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">  
            Information about affordable homes secured through the planning process or funded by the Mayor does not constitute personal data and is therefore not subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) or the Data Protection Act 2018. The information is also published elsewhere i.e. in planning documents (accommodation schedules) and the Land Registry.
